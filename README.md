# Metric/Imperial Unit Conversion

## Description
This project is a simple metric-to-imperial (and vice versa) unit converter, developed to practice my JavaScript (ES6+) skills after completing the Introduction to ES6 course on Scrimba. I also aimed to improve my front-end development skills. The application allows users to convert units of length, volume, and mass between the metric and imperial systems.

The project showcases modern JavaScript techniques such as ES6 destructing arrays, "for of" loop, classes and arrow functions for data manipulation. It also features a responsive user interface with light and dark themes.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DeepCodeRz/MerticMaster.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd MerticMaster
    ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to start using the app.

## Future Improvements
- Add more unit conversions (e.g., temperature, speed).
- Implement a history of conversions.
- Provide an option to switch between metric and imperial for all fields at once.
- Making the app fully responsive.
- Adding dark theme.
